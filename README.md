# Gelato Pitone

I took inspiration from the Love Sandwiches walkthrough project to create something similar but in a different setting. I decided to create a program with Python for a small ice cream truck company called "Gelato Pitone" where the different icetrucks can check the ice cream tastes available in the centralized database and receive information about the different choices available. I have created a Google spreadsheet with all the information about the different tastes.

Here is the link to the deployed Python terminal on [Heroku](xxxxxx) 

## Design process

Originally I had imagined how the different ice cream trucks could either read or insert data into the Google spreadsheet. The individual users would have been able to input how many liters of the different ice creams they have sold under one day and enable the spreadsheet to update showing how much ice cream was left in stock and return the profit for the user.

Here is a flowchart representing the original idea for my project:

Nevertheless after speaking with Luke Buchanan I realized that my project would be too similar to the walkthrough project so I decided to have a more complex datasheet where each ice cream taste would have different types of data attached to it, both integers and text.
